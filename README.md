# MahAppsWithAmmyUICaliburn

A simple example of how to use [MahApps.Metro](http://mahapps.com/), [Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/), and [Ammy](http://www.ammyui.com/) together. 

Based on the [MahApps.Metro.Caliburn.Demo](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/tree/develop/src/MahApps.Metro.Samples/MahApps.Metro.Caliburn.Demo) with the added twist of Ammy instead of XAML.
